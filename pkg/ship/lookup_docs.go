**Protocol Name**: SHIP (Service Host Interconnect Protocol)
**Lookup Service Name**: ` + "`SHIPLookupService`" + `

---

## Overview

The SHIP Lookup Service is used to **query** the known SHIP tokens in your overlay database. It allows you to discover nodes that have published SHIP outputs, indicating they host or participate in certain topics (prefixed ` + "`tm_`" + `).

This lookup service is typically invoked by sending a [LookupQuestion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bsv/overlay#lookupservice) with:
- ` + "`question.service = 'ls_ship'`" + `
- ` + "`question.query`" + ` containing parameters for searching.

---

## Purpose

- **Discovery**: Find all hosts that declared themselves via SHIP tokens.
- **Filtering**: Narrow results by domain, by topic, or both.

---

## Querying the SHIP Lookup Service

When you call ` + "`lookup(question)`" + ` on the SHIP Lookup Service, you must include:

1. **` + "`question.service`" + `** set to ` + "`\"ls_ship\"`" + `.
2. **` + "`question.query`" + `**: Can be one of the following:
   - ` + "`\"findAll\"`" + ` (string literal): Returns **all** known SHIP records.
   - An object of type:
     ` + "```" + `ts
     interface SHIPQuery {
       domain?: string
       topics?: string[]
     }
     ` + "```" + `
     where:
     - ` + "`domain`" + ` is an optional string. If provided, results will match that domain/advertisedURI.
     - ` + "`topics`" + ` is an optional string array. If provided, results will match any of those ` + "`tm_`" + ` topics.

### Examples

1. **Find all SHIP records**:
   ` + "```" + `js
   const question = {
     service: 'ls_ship',
     query: 'findAll'
   }
   const results = await overlayClient.lookup(question)
   ` + "```" + `

2. **Find by domain**:
   ` + "```" + `js
   const question = {
     service: 'ls_ship',
     query: { domain: 'https://myexample.com' }
   }
   const results = await overlayClient.lookup(question)
   ` + "```" + `

3. **Find by topics**:
   ` + "```" + `js
   const question = {
     service: 'ls_ship',
     query: { topics: ['tm_bridge', 'tm_sync'] }
   }
   const results = await overlayClient.lookup(question)
   ` + "```" + `

4. **Find by domain AND topics**:
   ` + "```" + `js
   const question = {
     service: 'ls_ship',
     query: {
       domain: 'https://myexample.com',
       topics: ['tm_bridge']
     }
   }
   const results = await overlayClient.lookup(question)
   ` + "```" + `

## Gotchas and Tips

- **Topic Prefix**: The SHIP manager expects topics to start with ` + "`tm_`" + `. If you see no results, ensure you used the correct prefix.
- **Strict Matching**: Domain matching requires an exact string match. If you have a different protocol (https vs https+bsvauth vs https+bsvauth+smf), be sure to store/lookup accordingly.
- **Partial Queries**: If you only provide ` + "`topics`" + `, domain-based filtering is not applied, and vice versa.
- **Multiple Topics**: Since ` + "`topics`" + ` is an array, the storage will return all records matching **any** listed topic.
