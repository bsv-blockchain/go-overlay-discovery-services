## Overview

The SHIP Topic Manager is responsible for identifying _admissible outputs_ in transactions that declare themselves as part of the SHIP protocol. In other words, it looks at transaction outputs (UTXOs) that embed certain metadata via a [PushDrop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bsv/sdk#pushdrop) locking script. This metadata must meet SHIP-specific requirements so that your node or application can recognize valid SHIP advertisements.

A **SHIP token** (in the context of BRC-101 overlays) is a UTXO containing information that advertises a node or host providing some topic-based service to the network. That topic must be prefixed with ` + "`tm_`" + ` — short for "topic manager."

---

## Purpose

- **Announce**: The SHIP token is used to signal that "this identity key is hosting a certain topic (prefixed with ` + "`tm_`" + `)."
- **Connect**: By publishing a SHIP output, a node indicates it offers some service or is a participant in a specific overlay "topic."
- **Authorize**: The SHIP token includes a signature which binds it to an identity key, ensuring authenticity and preventing impersonation.

This allows other nodes to discover hosts by querying the lookup service for valid SHIP tokens.

## Requirements for a Valid SHIP Output

1. **PushDrop Fields**: Exactly five fields must be present:
   1. ` + "`\"SHIP\"`" + ` — The protocol identifier string.
   2. ` + "`identityKey`" + ` — The 33-byte compressed DER secp256k1 public key that claims to own this UTXO.
   3. ` + "`advertisedURI`" + ` — A URI string describing how or where to connect (see BRC-101).
   4. ` + "`topic`" + ` — A string that identifies the topic. Must:
      - Start with ` + "`tm_`" + `
      - Pass the BRC-87 checks
   5. ` + "`signature`" + ` — A valid signature (in DER) proving that ` + "`identityKey`" + ` is authorizing this output, in conjunction with the PushDrop locking key.

2. **Signature Verification**:
   - The signature in the last field must be valid for the data in the first 4 fields.
   - It must match the identity key, which in turn must match the locking public key used in the output script.
   - See the code in ` + "`isTokenSignatureCorrectlyLinked`" + ` for the implementation details.

3. **Advertised URI**:
   - Must align with what is contemplated in BRC-101, which enforces certain URI formats (e.g., ` + "`https://`" + `, ` + "`wss://`" + `, or custom prefixed ` + "`https+bsvauth...`" + ` URIs).
   - No ` + "`localhost`" + ` or invalid URIs allowed.

If any of these checks fail, the SHIP token output is _not_ admitted by the topic manager.

## Gotchas and Tips

- **Field Ordering**: The fields **must** appear in the exact order specified above (SHIP -> identityKey -> advertisedURI -> topic -> signature).
- **Exact Five Fields**: More or fewer fields will cause the manager to skip the output.
- **Proper Locking Script**: Ensure the output is locked with a valid [PushDrop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bsv/sdk#pushdrop) format. If the ` + "`lockingScript`" + ` can't be decoded by ` + "`PushDrop`" + `, the output is invalid.
- **Signature Data**: The signature is a raw ECDSA signature over the raw bytes of the preceding fields. The manager expects that the identity key and signature match up with the logic in ` + "`isTokenSignatureCorrectlyLinked`" + `.
- **Funding**: Remember to fund your SHIP output with at least one satoshi so it remains unspent if you want your advertisement to be valid.
