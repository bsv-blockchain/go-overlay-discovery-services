**Protocol Name**: SLAP (Service Lookup Availability Protocol)  
**Manager Name**: ` + "`SLAPTopicManager`" + `  

---

## Overview

The SLAP Topic Manager is responsible for identifying valid SLAP outputs in transactions. These outputs advertise the availability of a **lookup service** that can be accessed within an overlay network. By publishing a SLAP token, a node declares it is providing a specific service, prefixed ` + "`ls_`" + `.

---

## Purpose

- **Announce**: Declare that the identity key provides a certain lookup service, such as ` + "`ls_example`" + ` or other overlay lookups.
- **Availability**: Indicate that the node or service is currently active and can be queried via the provided URI.

---

## Requirements for a Valid SLAP Output

Similar to SHIP, SLAP tokens must follow a specific 5-field structure in a [PushDrop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bsv/sdk#pushdrop) script:

1. ` + "`\"SLAP\"`" + ` — The literal string indicating SLAP protocol.
2. ` + "`identityKey`" + ` — The public key that claims ownership of this advertisement.
3. ` + "`advertisedURI`" + ` — A valid URI, aligning with what is contemplated in BRC-101.
4. ` + "`service`" + ` — The name of the service. Must:
   - Pass the BRC-87 checks.
   - Start with ` + "`ls_`" + `.
5. ` + "`signature`" + ` — The ECDSA signature from ` + "`identityKey`" + ` covering the above 4 fields.

---

## Signature and Locking Key

The final field is a signature that **must** link back to the identity key. The ` + "`SLAPTopicManager`" + ` uses the ` + "`isTokenSignatureCorrectlyLinked`" + ` code to confirm:

- The signature is valid for the data in the first four fields.
- The ` + "`lockingPublicKey`" + ` of the UTXO matches the derived key from the identity key used to sign.

If any step fails, the SLAP output is rejected.

---

## Data Format and Validation

1. **Exact 5 PushDrop Fields**:
   - If fewer or more than 5 fields are found, the SLAP manager will skip the output.
2. **Valid ` + "`service`" + `**:
   - Must begin with ` + "`ls_`" + `.
   - Only letters (lowercase) and underscores are allowed, per ` + "`isValidTopicOrServiceName`" + ` (BRC-87).
3. **Advertised URI**:
   - Must not be ` + "`localhost`" + `.
   - Must use a recognized scheme (` + "`https://`" + `, ` + "`wss://`" + `, or specialized custom ` + "`https+bsvauth...`" + ` forms).
4. **Signature**:
   - Must be in DER format.
   - Must match the identity key.
